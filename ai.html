  <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
  <div class="section section1">
    <h2>What is Artificial intelligence?</h2>
    <p><span></span>AI software is a type of computer software that enables the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process large amounts of data to solve tasks that otherwise require human intelligence. Such tasks include image recognition, video analytics, voice recognition, text recognition, and NLP.<br><br>
    
    <span></span>The strategic importance of AI technology is growing exponentially across industries. Many businesses are exploring and investing in AI solutions to stay competitive. Late movers are at risk of falling behind their competitors in terms of technological adoption and innovation.<br><br>
    
    <span></span>This is because AI has the ability to automate tasks and processes that would otherwise not be possible or carried out by humans. As a result, businesses that don’t adopt AI will lose out on cost efficiencies, productivity advantages, and product or service quality.

    <h2>Most used Ai</h2>
    <div class="ai-list">
      <h3>ChatGpt</h3>
      <p><span></span>ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot developed by OpenAI that is able to interact in conversational dialogue form and provide responses that can appear surprisingly human (read more about Natural Language Processing, NLP). It was trained on massive amounts of data about code and information from the internet, including sources like Reddit discussions, to help ChatGPT learn dialogue and attain a human style of responding. Additionally, ChatGPT was trained using human feedback, a technique called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, so that the AI learned what humans expected when they asked a question.<br><br>
      
      <span></span>ChatGPT is a hugely successful tool, with over one million users only weeks after launch. However, major companies such as JPMorgan Chase, Amazon, Verizon, and Accenture have barred staff from using the AI chatbot, some even blocked it entirely. An important limitation is that because ChatGPT is trained to provide answers that feel right to humans, the answers can trick humans that the output is correct. Hence, the responses may be factually wrong and deceiving. Moreover, some organizations are concerned that employees may share sensitive or confidential information.</p>

    <h2 id="ad-head">What are the advantages of using AI?</h2>
    <div class="advantage">
      <h2>1. Reduction for human error. <i class="plus">&plus;</i> <i class="minus">&minus;</i></h2>
      <p>
        <span></span>One of the biggest advantages of Artificial Intelligence is that it can significantly reduce errors and increase accuracy and precision. The decisions taken by AI in every step is decided by information previously gathered and a certain set of algorithms. When programmed properly, these errors can be reduced to null.<br><br>
        
        Example:<br>
        <span></span> An example of the reduction in human error through AI is the use of robotic surgery systems, which can perform complex procedures with precision and accuracy, reducing the risk of human error and improving patient safety in healthcare.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="advantage">
      <h2>2. Zero Risks. <i class="plus">&plus;</i> <i class="minus">&minus;</i></h2>
      <p>
        <span></span>Another big advantage of AI is that humans can overcome many risks by letting AI robots do them for us. Whether it be defusing a bomb, going to space, exploring the deepest parts of oceans, machines with metal bodies are resistant in nature and can survive unfriendly atmospheres. Moreover, they can provide accurate work with greater responsibility and not wear out easily.<br><br>
        
        Example:<br>
        <span></span>One example of zero risks is a fully automated production line in a manufacturing facility. Robots perform all tasks, eliminating the risk of human error and injury in hazardous environments.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="advantage">
       <h2>3. 24/7 availability. <i class="plus">&plus;</i> <i class="minus">&minus;</i></h2>
       <p>
         <span></span>There are many studies that show humans are productive only about 3 to 4 hours in a day. Humans also need breaks and time offs to balance their work life and personal life. But AI can work endlessly without breaks. They think much faster than humans and perform multiple tasks at a time with accurate results. They can even handle tedious repetitive jobs easily with the help of AI algorithms.<br><br>
         
         Example:<br>
         <span></span>An example of this is online customer support chatbots, which can provide instant assistance to customers anytime, anywhere. Using AI and natural language processing, chatbots can answer common questions, resolve issues, and escalate complex problems to human agents, ensuring seamless customer service around the clock.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="advantage">
      <h2>4. Digital Assistance. <i class="plus">&plus;</i> <i class="minus">&minus;</i></h2>
      <p>
        <span></span>Some of the most technologically advanced companies engage with users using digital assistants, which eliminates the need for human personnel. Many websites utilize digital assistants to deliver user-requested content. We can discuss our search with them in conversation. Some chatbots are built in a way that makes it difficult to tell whether we are conversing with a human or a chatbot.<br><br>
        
        Example:<br>
        <span></span>We all know that businesses have a customer service crew that must address the doubts and concerns of the patrons. Businesses can create a chatbot or voice bot that can answer all of their clients' questions using AI.
      </p>

    <div class="advantage">
      <h2>5. New Inventions. <i class="plus">&plus;</i> <i class="minus">&minus;</i></h2>
      <p>
        <span></span>In practically every field, AI is the driving force behind numerous innovations that will aid humans in resolving the majority of challenging issues.<br>
        
        <span></span>For instance, recent advances in AI-based technologies have allowed doctors to detect breast cancer in a woman at an earlier stage.<br><br>
        
        Example:<br>
        <span></span>Another example of new inventions is self-driving cars, which use a combination of cameras, sensors, and AI algorithms to navigate roads and traffic without human intervention. Self-driving cars have the potential to improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and increase accessibility for people with disabilities or limited mobility. They are being developed by various companies, including Tesla, Google, and Uber, and are expected to revolutionize transportation.

    <h2 id="ad-head">What are the disadvantage of using AI?</h2>
    <div class="advantage">
      <h2>1. High cost <i class="plus"> &plus;</i><i class="minus">&minus;</i></h2>
      <p>
        <span></span>The ability to create a machine that can simulate human intelligence is no small feat. It requires plenty of time and resources and can cost a huge deal of money. AI also needs to operate on the latest hardware and software to stay updated and meet the latest requirements, thus making it quite costly.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="advantage">
      <h2>2. No Creativity. <i class="plus">&plus;</i> <i class="minus">&minus;</i> </h2>
      <p>
        <span></span>A big disadvantage of AI is that it cannot learn to think outside the box. AI is capable of learning over time with pre-fed data and past experiences, but cannot be creative in its approach. A classic example is the bot Quill who can write Forbes earning reports. These reports only contain data and facts already provided to the bot. Although it is impressive that a bot can write an article on its own, it lacks the human touch present in other Forbes articles. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="advantage">
      <h2>3. Unemployment.  <i class="plus">&plus;</i> <i class="minus">&minus;</i> </h2>
      <p>
        <span></span>One application of artificial intelligence is a robot, which is displacing occupations and increasing unemployment (in a few cases). Therefore, some claim that there is always a chance of unemployment as a result of chatbots and robots replacing humans.<br><br>
        
        <span></span>For instance, robots are frequently utilized to replace human resources in manufacturing businesses in some more technologically advanced nations like Japan. This is not always the case, though, as it creates additional opportunities for humans to work while also replacing humans in order to increase efficiency.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="advantage">
      <h2>4. Make Human Lazy. <i class="plus">&plus;</i> <i class="minus">&minus;</i> </h2>
      <p>
        <span></span>AI applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive tasks. Since we do not have to memorize things or solve puzzles to get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less. This addiction to AI can cause problems to future generations.
